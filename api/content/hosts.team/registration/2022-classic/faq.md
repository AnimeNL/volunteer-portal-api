Organising a festival such as AnimeCon 2022: Classic is quite a feat, and we imagine that you may
have many questions about your participation. We've collected some questions and answers on this
page, but always feel free to ask us anything over WhatsApp, or by
[sending us an e-mail](mailto:security@animecon.nl).

### What are your plans surrounding the Coronavirus?
As the past two years have shown, the situation caused by the Coronavirus continues to be volatile
and unpredictable. While we fully expect to be able to open our doors again during AnimeCon 2022,
we may have to cancel again if we cannot guarantee the safety of everyone involved.

During the event, all Staff, volunteers and visitors must meet the requirements of the Dutch
government that apply during our festival, including any rule changes that are announced shortly
before or during the event. At present, this means that every attendee must be in possession of a
COVID certificate, with either proof of vaccination or proof of recovery. We have not yet made a
decision on whether negative test results will be accepted.

### When will I receive confirmation of my registration?
You should receive a confirmation e-mail within a few days of your application. Whether you'll be
able to join the team will be confirmed depending on your circumstances.

  * Volunteers who were accepted during one of our cancelled events will have their participation
    accepted automatically. We truly appreciate your persistence!
  * All other applications will be considered on a monthly basis, and we'll provide you with a
    confirmation no more than a month after your application.

We ask that you do not cancel your participation after **September 1st**, and do not expect to
accept further registrations after **September 7th**.

### Would I be able to help out on Thursday or Monday too?
Absolutely! We'll be in the venue preparing for the festival all day Thursday, and will be tearing
everything down again on Monday. This is a unique opportunity to get a glimpse behind the scenes of
a festival such as AnimeCon. It's casual, a lot of fun, and a great way to meet the rest of the
broader organisation.

We'll tally interested volunteers about a month before the festival starts. Feel free to reach out
to any of our seniors if you're keen to learn more.

### Will you reimburse my travel expenses?
The AnimeCon festivals aim to be as affordable as possible for our attendees, as a consequence of
which we unfortunately cannot reimburse travel expenses, nor any other types of expenses. If there
are cases in which you feel we should make an exception, please do
[send us an e-mail](mailto:security@animecon.nl) so that we can discuss in detail.

### What happens if I cannot help out as a Festival Host?
There are two other volunteering teams that you're able to join during AnimeCon 2022: Classic: the
[Gophers](https://gophers.team/registration/2022-classic/) and the
[Stewards](https://stewards.team/registration/2022-classic/). Check out their websites when you'd
like to learn more—we're confident there's a way for you to help out no matter what you bring to the
table!

### What will happen with my information?
Please consult the [GDPR and data sharing policies](gdpr.html) of the Volunteering Team.
