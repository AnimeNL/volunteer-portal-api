We have reserved a block of hotel rooms in the nearby **Best Western Hotel** that will be made
available to our volunteers at discounted rates. Because the rooms are in high demand, we ask that
you share the room with other volunteers. Please reach out to us if you would prefer not to, and
we'll do our best to accomodate.
