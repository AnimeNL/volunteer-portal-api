## What is expected of you?

  * You're at least 13 years of age during AnimeCon 2024, and are able to communicate clearly in
    both Dutch and English.

  * You're able to be present at the festival from about 11am on Friday, all the way to 8pm on

  * You're able to help us out with about 12 hours of shifts during the festival. Any events that

## What sort of activities would I help out with?

  * The **registration desk** is eager to work with you to welcome all visitors to the festival.
    You'll be the first volunteer they see, be ready to answer all their questions!

  * At the **bag room** you'll help to make sure that visitors have the ability to quickly and
    safely store their coats and other belongings, while they enjoy the festival.

  * Various **events** will take place during the festival, during which you'll be able to help
    setting them up and provide assistance during the workshop, lecture, etcetera.

  * Helping out at the **bring & buy** means that you're helping our visitors sell their memorabilia
    for a little bit of money, in the heart of the dealer room.

AnimeCon 2024 will have a huge number of activities going on throughout the day, so you definitely
won't be bored when there's nothing to attend.

## What do you get from us?

  * A free ticket to the festival; we'll either refund your AnimeCon 2024 ticket, or issue you a
    free one for one of our future events.

  * Sandwiches, snacks, drinks and other nibbles during the festival, as well as a place to relax in
    our **Volunteer Lounge**, a free volunteering t-shirt & a special badge.

  * Access to the **Crew channel** on the [AnimeCon Discord](https://discord.gg/yvYH9MK), and access
    to our **WhatsApp group** where we discuss anything and everything about our festival.
