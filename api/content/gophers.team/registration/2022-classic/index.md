Gophers are the largest, and possibly the most important group of volunteers during the
[AnimeCon 2022: Classic](https://animecon.nl) festival, which will be taking place in Almelo in
September. Together with the rest of the team, you'll be responsible for delivering an incredible
experience to all our visitors by helping them out directly, as well as behind the scenes.

Check out this page for more information, the perks and expectations, and to apply straight away!

## What is expected of you?

  * You're at least 13 years of age during AnimeCon 2022: Classic (September 23-25), and are
    able to communicate clearly in both Dutch and English.

  * You're able to be present at the [Theaterhotel](https://www.theaterhotel.nl/) in Almelo from
    about 12pm on Friday, all the way to 8pm on Sunday.

  * You're able to help us out with about 12 hours of shifts during the festival. Any events that
    you _really_ want to attend as a visitor will of course be taken into account.

## What sort of activities would I help out with?

  * The **registration desk** is eager to work with you to welcome all visitors to the festival.
    You'll be the first volunteer they see, be ready to answer all their questions!

  * At the **bag room** you'll help to make sure that visitors have the ability to quickly and
    safely store their coats and other belongings, while they enjoy the festival.

  * Various **events** will take place during the festival, during which you'll be able to help
    setting them up and provide assistance during the workshop, lecture, etcetera.

  * Helping out at the **bring & buy** means that you're helping our visitors sell their memorabilia
    for a little bit of money, in the heart of the dealer room.

AnimeCon 2022: Classic will have a huge number of activities going on throughout the day, so you
definitely won't be bored when there's nothing to attend.

## What do you get from us?

  * A free ticket to the festival; we'll either refund your AnimeCon 2022: Classic ticket, or issue
    you a free one for one of our future events.

  * Sandwiches, snacks, drinks and other nibbles during the festival, as well as a place to relax in
    our **Volunteer Lounge**, a free volunteering t-shirt & a special badge.
