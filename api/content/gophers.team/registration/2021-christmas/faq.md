Organising a festival such as AnimeCon 2021: Christmas Edition is quite a feat, and we imagine that
you may have many questions about your participation. We've collected some questions and answers
on this page, but always feel free to ask us anything over WhatsApp, or by
[sending us an e-mail](mailto:gopherplanning@animecon.nl).

### How many gophers do you expect to need this year?
AnimeCon 2021: Christmas Edition takes place over two days instead of the usual three, and the venue
will be locked up overnight. We anticipate to have about 500 hours of shifts to schedule, for which
we are looking for between **30 and 40 gophers**.

### When will I receive confirmation of my registration?
You should receive a confirmation e-mail within a few days of your application. Whether you'll be
able to join the team will be confirmed in two phases:

  * **Early registrations**, prior to October 10th, receive confirmation in the week of October 11,
  * **Late registrations**, prior to October 31st, receive confirmation in the week of November 1.

We do not expect to accept further registrations after November 1st.

### When do I need to arrive at the Broodfabriek?
We expect you to be present at the location at **9:00 in the morning** of Saturday, December 11.
Yes, this is awfully early indeed. You may want to consider getting a hotel room nearby in case
travel distance doesn't enable you to make this time.

Shortly after this time, our team will host a briefing which will tell you about everything you need
to know about AnimeCon 2021: Christmas Edition, after which it's time to welcome our visitors. Of
course, if you are around on Friday, you'll be most welcome to help setting everything up.

Please [send us an e-mail](mailto:gopherplanning@animecon.nl) prior to signing up in case this will
be an issue, and we'll do our best to accommodate your needs.

### Would I be able to help out on Friday or Monday too?
Absolutely. We'll be in the venue preparing for the festival all day Friday, and will be tearing
everything down again on Monday. This is a unique opportunity to get a glimpse behind the scenes of
a festival such as AnimeCon. It's casual, a lot of fun, and a great way to meet the rest of the
broader organisation.

Let one of the seniors know if you're in the area and are keen to help out during one of those days.
Any help will be greatly appreciated, even if it's just for a couple of hours.

### What are your plans surrounding the Coronavirus?
All Staff, volunteers and visitors must meet the requirements of the Dutch government that apply
during our festival, including any rule changes that are announced shortly before or during the
event. This means that every attendee must be in possession of a COVID certificate, with a negative
test result, proof of vaccination or proof of recovery.

Of course, we will cancel the festival if it's not safe to host an event in December of this year.
All volunteers and visitors will be informed in a timely manner if this happens.

### When can I sign up for the AnimeCon 2022 festivals?
AnimeCon will host two festivals in 2022, the regular edition in June, and a Classic edition in
September. We expect to start accepting volunteering applications for those festivals about four
months before they commence.

### What will happen with my information?
Please consult the [GDPR and data sharing policies](gdpr.html) of the Steward Team.
