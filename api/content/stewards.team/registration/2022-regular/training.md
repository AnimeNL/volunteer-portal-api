Stewards are responsible for crowd management, various checks, escorts and support our security
and first aid teams. In order to make sure that you're fully prepared, we provide a
**professional steward training** that we require volunteers to participate in every other year.

## When will the training take place?
This year we've been able to schedule trainings on **Sunday, May 22nd**, **Saturday, June 4th** and
on **Sunday, June 5th**.

## Where will they be taking place?
The trainings are hosted by the [EHBO College](https://ehbocollege.nl/) in Amersfoort. Their venue
has free parking available, and is fully accessible by public transport as well. While any **costs
incurred by travelling to the venue will not be reimbursed**, we'll take care of lunch and drinks.

## What happens when I cannot attend?
Stewards are required to participate in this training once every other year. Given that we have not
been able to host a festival for over two years now, all stewards are expected to participate.

Unfortunately you will not be able to help out as a steward when you're not able to attend. We can,
however, offer you a position in our _Festival Hosts_ team, who make sure that all visitors are
able to find their way around the venue.
