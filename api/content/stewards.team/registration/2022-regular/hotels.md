We have reserved a block of hotel rooms in the nearby **Best Western** and **Stay at Seven** hotels
that will be made available to our volunteers at discounted rates. Because the rooms are in high
demand, we ask that you share the room with another volunteers. Please reach out to us if you would
prefer not to, and we'll do our best to accomodate.
