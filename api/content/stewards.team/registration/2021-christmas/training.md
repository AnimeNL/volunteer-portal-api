Stewards are responsible for crowd management, various checks, escorts and support our security
and first aid teams. In order to make sure that you're fully prepared, we provide a
**professional steward training** that we require volunteers to participate in every other year.

## When will the training take place?
Dates for the trainings for AnimeCon 2021: Christmas Edition have not been announced yet.

## Where will they be taking place?
The trainings are hosted by the [EHBO College](https://ehbocollege.nl/) in Amersfoort. Their venue
has free parking available, and is fully accessible by public transport as well. While any **costs
incurred by travelling to the venue will not be reimbursed**, we'll take care of lunch and drinks.

## What happens when I cannot attend?
Stewards are required to participate in this training once every other year. Given that there were
no AnimeCon festivals during 2021, all stewards are expected to partake.

Unfortunately you will not be able to help out as a steward when you're not able to attend. We can,
however, offer you a position in our _Festival Elves_ team, who make sure that all visitors are
able to find their way around the venue.
