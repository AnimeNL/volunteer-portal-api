We have reserved a block of hotel rooms in the nearby **Best Western Hotel** that will be made
available to our volunteers at discounted rates. Because the rooms are in high demand, we ask that
you share the room with other volunteers. Please reach out to us if you would prefer not to, and
we'll do our best to accomodate.

## Best Western Hotel
Each room is inclusive of breakfast, but you'll be charged an additional €3 per person per night by
the hotel for a tourism tax. We cannot offer these rooms without breakfast.

| Type           | Price      | Price per person    |
| -------------- | ---------- | ------------------- |
| 1-person room  | €87/night  | €87/person/night    |
| 2-person room  | €105/night | €52.50/person/night |
| 3-person room  | €145/night | €48.33/person/night |
| 4-person room* | €184/night | €46/person/night    |

* _The hotel is not able to guarantee availability of 4-person rooms at this time._

## Alternative hotels
There are many alternative hotels available in the cities of Rijswijk, The Hague and the rest of the
neighbourhood, at various price points. We recommend having a look around
[Booking.com](https://booking.com) and similar websites to see what your options are.
