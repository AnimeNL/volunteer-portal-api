We have reserved blocks of hotel rooms in the nearby **Bastion** hotel, as well as the **Campanile**
and **Shanghai** hotels in Delft. Because the rooms are in high demand, we ask that you share the
room with another volunteers. Please reach out to us if you would prefer not to, and we'll do our
best to accomodate.

>> Breakfast on these rooms will be paid for by Stichting J-POP, however, the mentioned prices are
>> still inclusive of breakfast and thus have to be reduced. Prices will be reduced as soon as
>> possible.

participating in night shifts or to accomodate for disabilities.

## Is breakfast included with the rooms?
Yes, Stichting J-POP will cover breakfast for all volunteers for whom we reserve a hotel room. This
is in addition to sandwiches and other snacks offered on the festival's grounds. We unfortunately
cannot cover breakfast for rooms you book yourself.

## How would I get to the Campanile and Shanghai hotels?
We'll provide a taxi service between the hotels and the festival's location that's free to use for
volunteers for whom we reserve a hotel room. A limited number of parking spots are available next to
the Broodfabriek in case you would prefer to use your own vehicle.

## Are there any other hotels nearby?
There are many alternative hotels available in the cities of Rijswijk, The Hague and the rest of the
neighbourhood, at various price points. We recommend having a look around
[Booking.com](https://booking.com) and similar websites to see what your options are.
