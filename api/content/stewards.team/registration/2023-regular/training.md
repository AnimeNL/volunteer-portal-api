Stewards are responsible for crowd management, various checks, escorts and support our security
and first aid teams. In order to make sure that you're fully prepared, we provide a
**professional steward training** that we require volunteers to participate in every other year.

>> We are still working on finalizing the details for this year's trainings, please expect them to
>> happen in or near the festival's venue in Rijswijk throughout the month of May.

## What happens when I cannot attend?
Stewards are required to participate in this training once every other year. Given that we have not
been able to host a festival for over two years now, all stewards are expected to participate.

Unfortunately you will not be able to help out as a steward when you're not able to attend. We can,
however, offer you a position in our _Festival Hosts_ team, who make sure that all visitors are
able to find their way around the venue.
