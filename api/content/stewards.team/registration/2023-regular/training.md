Stewards are responsible for crowd management, various checks, escorts and support our security
and first aid teams. In order to make sure that you're fully prepared, we provide a
**professional steward training** that we require volunteers to participate in every other year.

## When will the trainings take place?
We'll host the trainings on **Saturday, May 27th** and **Saturday, June 3rd**, in Tiel. During the
training we'll start with a BLS-AED course for which you will receive a certification, followed by
information about this year's AnimeCon event, after which we'll focus on communication and managing
escalations supported by a professional actor.

Coffee, lunch and snacks will be provided throughout the day.

## What happens when I cannot attend?
Stewards are required to participate in this training once every other year. Given that we have not
been able to host a festival for over two years now, all stewards are expected to participate.
Please reach out to us as soon as possible if you're not able to participate.
