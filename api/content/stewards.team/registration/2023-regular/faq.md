Organising a festival such as AnimeCon 2022 is quite a feat, and we imagine that you may have many
questions about your participation. We've collected some questions and answers on this page, but
always feel free to ask us anything over WhatsApp, or by [sending us an e-mail](mailto:security@animecon.nl).

### When will I receive confirmation of my registration?
You should receive a confirmation e-mail within a week of your application. The team considers
applications on a monthly basis, after which we'll confirm your participation as soon as possible.

We ask that you do not cancel your participation after **April 1st**, and do not expect to accept
further registrations after **May 1st**.

### Would I be able to help out on Thursday or Monday too?
Absolutely! We'll be in the venue preparing for the festival all day Thursday, and will be tearing
everything down again on Monday. This is a unique opportunity to get a glimpse behind the scenes of
a festival such as AnimeCon. It's casual, a lot of fun, and a great way to meet the rest of the
broader organisation.

We'll tally interested volunteers about a month before the festival starts. Feel free to reach out
to any of our seniors if you're keen to learn more.

### Will you reimburse my travel expenses?
The AnimeCon festivals aim to be as affordable as possible for our attendees, as a consequence of
which we unfortunately cannot reimburse travel expenses, nor any other types of expenses.

### What happens if I cannot help out as a steward?
There are two other volunteering teams that you're able to join during AnimeCon 2023: the
[Gophers](https://gophers.team/registration/2023-regular) and the
[Festival Hosts](https://hosts.team/registration/2023-regular). Check out their websites when you'd
like to learn more—we're confident there's a way for you to help out no matter what you bring to the
table!

### Will there be an AnimeCon 2023: Classic Edition?
At this point we have nothing to announce regarding a possible second edition in 2023.

### What will happen with my information?
Please consult the [GDPR and data sharing policies](gdpr.html) of the Volunteering Team.
