We have reserved a block of hotel rooms in the [Theaterhotel](https://www.theaterhotel.nl/) that
will be made available to our volunteers at discounted rates. Because the rooms are in high demand,
we ask that you share the room with another volunteers. Please reach out to us if you would prefer
not to, and we'll do our best to accomodate.

## Theaterhotel
The following prices are based on a stay from Friday until Sunday (two nights), assuming two people
per room. They exclude a €3 tourism tax per person per night, to be paid on site. Each room is
inclusive of breakfast and one dinner per person, the costs of which will be covered by AnimeCon.

| Type               | Price/night |
| ---------          | ----------  |
| Standard kamer     | €144        |
| Comfort kamer      | €154        |
| Luxe comfort kamer | €164        |

You can find [an overview](https://www.theaterhotel.nl/overnachten) of the different types of rooms
on the Theaterhotel website. You're welcome to stay longer, and you're even welcome to book one of
the suites yourself, but please be aware that different prices may apply.

Finally, [this page](https://www.theaterhotel.nl/over-ons/routebeschrijving-parkeren) will tell
you about available parking options near the Theaterhotel. Parking isn't included in the price.

### Planning on helping out on Thursday or Monday?
Building up and tearing down for a festival such as ours takes a lot of time and effort, something
we could definitely use your help with. If you're willing to help out on Thursday and/or Monday for
a decent chunk of time⁠—at least 6 hours⁠—then please let us know and we'll gladly cover the costs
for the extra night(s).

## Alternative hotels
There are various other hotels in the area that you can book yourself. AnimeCon will provide a bus
service to the more popular hotels, for which we're hoping to be able to arrange a discount for
volunteers. Some of our recommendations include:

  * [Van der Valk Hotel Hengelo](https://www.hotelhengelo.com/)
  * [City Hotel Hengelo](https://www.cityhotelhengelo.com/en/)
