Stewards are the hosts of our festival, the first line of defense when trouble arises. If you're
eager to help out with crowd management, safety checks, escorting special guests and assisting our
security and first aid teams, then we are looking for **you**!

## What is expected of you?

  * You're at least 18 years of age during AnimeCon 2022: Classic (September 23-25), and are
    able to communicate clearly in both Dutch and English.

  * You're able to be present at the [Theaterhotel](https://www.theaterhotel.nl/) in Almelo from
    about 11am on Friday, all the way to 8pm on Sunday.

  * You're able to help us out with about 15 hours of [shifts](schedule.html) during the festival.
    Any events that you _really_ want to attend as a visitor will of course be taken into account.

## What do you get from us?

  * A free ticket to the festival; we'll either refund your AnimeCon 2022: Classic ticket, or issue
    you a free one for one of our future events.

  * Sandwiches, snacks, drinks and other nibbles during the festival, as well as a place to relax in
    our Volunteer Lounge and a free volunteering t-shirt.

  * The ability to book [a hotel room](hotels.html) in the Best Western at a discounted rate, right
    across the corner from the venue.

Please check out the [frequently asked questions](faq.html) in case anything is unclear, or reach
out to us [by e-mail](mailto:security@animecon.nl).
