Stewards are responsible for crowd management, various checks, escorts and support our security
and first aid teams. In order to make sure that you're fully prepared, we provide a
**professional steward training** that we require volunteers to participate in every other year.

## What will we be doing?
During the training we'll start with a BLS-AED course for which you will receive a certification,
followed by information about this year's AnimeCon event. After that we'll focus on communication
and managing escalations, in realistic scenarios you may run in to during the event, in a course
supported by a professional actor.

Coffee, lunch and snacks will be provided throughout the day.

## What happens when I cannot attend?
Stewards are required to participate in this training once every other year, although we can make
exceptions depending on your circumstances. Please reach out if you have any questions and we'll do
our best to accomodate.
