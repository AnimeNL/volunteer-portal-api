Each volunteer will receive a personal schedule for the festival, which will be shared with them a
few weeks before the festival begins. This enables us to make sure that stewards—as well as other
volunteers—are available during all important events.

We expect to schedule each steward for about 15 hours of shifts during AnimeCon 2024. Historically,
however, many stewards have shown to be highly proactive and help out on their own accord outside of
this schedule. While appreciated, this is not an expectation.

The schedules will be shared through a mobile website. We expect every volunteer to be in possession
of a mobile device with an internet connection.

## What does a schedule look like?
